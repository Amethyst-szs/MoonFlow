# Dialogue Balloons
One of the most common goals of designing an event data flowchart is writing character dialogue, however in order to display text to the screen we need somewhere to put it! Introducing: The MessageBalloon.

## Types of Balloon
A dialogue balloon can come in three different forms, a small text balloon (default), a talk interaction balloon, and an icon balloon. Each has a wildly different purpose and functionality, and will be covered in detail below.
