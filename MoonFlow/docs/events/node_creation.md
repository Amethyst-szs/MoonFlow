# Creating new Nodes
Each action performed by your flowchart will be contained within a node. There's around 102 nodes built in Super Mario Odyssey, and all of them are available in MoonFlow. Sometimes it can be tricky to find exactly what you need, so that's when these tools and tricks will come in handy.

## Add Menu
The quickest and simplest way to grab a node is to use the add menu, providing quick access to every type of node. To open the add menu, **right-click**, press **Ctrl + N** *(default keybind)*, or press the plus in the header. 

The search box is always automatically focused, allowing quick access to any specific node types. Not 100% sure what you're looking for? Take a scroll through the organized categories! 

**Did you know:** By **right-clicking** any option in the add menu you can favorite it! This will move that type right up to the top and quickly accessible, a big timesaver for frequently used nodes like dialogue!

However, lots of nodes are full of special properties that influence their behavior. If you aren't sure exactly what settings you need, that's when an old classic can come to play: 
## Copy + Paste
MoonFlow's UI is designed after a standard desktop layout, featuring a taskbar full of applications. This means you can open as many different flowcharts at once as you'd like, which makes it super fast to access nodes from other graphs and paste them into your own!
